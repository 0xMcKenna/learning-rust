01.1 - Hello Cargo

Cargo:

Rust system and package manager.

Setup - cargo new project_name

Cargo.toml:

TOML - Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language
=> Cargo configuration format

[package] => following statements configure a package
e.g. name, version, edition (needed to compile)

[dependencies] => list project dependencies
crate = package of code

src:

Where source files reside.


Cargo Commands:

cargo build - Creates executeable to run
./target/debug/hello_cargo - executeable to run in terminal.

cargo run - compile code and run the executable in a single command.

cargo check - Checks code to ensure it compiles.

* cargo check runs faster than cargo build because it does not produce an
executeable. Good practise to run after adding code.




Cargo.lock:

Keeps track of exact versions of dependensies.
